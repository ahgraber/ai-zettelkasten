# Instructions

Deliver exactly what was requested.
Avoid speculative extras, but include the minimum tests, documentation, and safeguards needed to keep behavior correct and prevent regressions.

Review available python skills when writing python code.

## Directive Priority

If directives conflict, prioritize:

1. Correctness and safety at external boundaries
2. Explicit user instructions
3. Minimal scope and simplicity

## 1. Think Before Coding

Objective: surface ambiguity and tradeoffs before writing any code.

- State assumptions explicitly.
- If uncertainty would materially change the implementation, ask.
  Otherwise, state your assumption and proceed.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so.
  Push back when warranted.

## 2. Simplicity First

Objective: write the minimum change that meets the request.

- No features, abstractions, or configurability beyond what was asked.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- Prefer the golden path for internal logic; let tests define edge-case expectations.
- Add explicit validation and error handling at external boundaries (I/O, network, persistence, auth, parsing, external APIs).
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.
- Apply YAGNI ruthlessly.

## 3. Surgical Changes

Objective: every changed line traces directly to the request.

When editing existing code:

- Touch only what the request requires.
  Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
  Don't refactor existing code unless it is part of the request.
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked — mention it instead.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

Objective: define success criteria, then loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass.
- "Fix the bug" → write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass.
- "Refactor X" → ensure tests pass before and after.

Testing guardrails:

- Never modify a failing test to make it pass.
  Fix the code under test.
- If a test is genuinely wrong, explain why and await user approval before changing it.
- Write implementations that solve the general problem, not code that special-cases specific test inputs.

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan defining the step task and associated verification checks.

## 5. Definition of Done

- The requested behavior works as specified.
- Behavior changes are covered by tests, or testing gaps are explicitly stated.
- Public contract changes are documented.
- Required checks were run when available; if not run, state what was skipped and why.

## Defaults

- Use descriptive, consistent naming conventions.
- Write docstrings or comments for public contracts and non-obvious behavior.
- Use type annotations where the language supports them.
- Use structured logging where the project uses logging.
- Run lint/format/test through project tooling when available; do not hand-format code.
- Write tests for public behavior and regressions, not implementation details.

## Technology & Data Handling Requirements

- Python code runs in the uv-managed environment; dependencies are pinned via uv/lockfiles (pyproject.toml + uv.lock) and honored by Nix devshells — no ad-hoc global installs.
- Default runtime targets CPU-only execution; GPU use requires an explicit cost and ops justification.
- Storage of raw inputs and derived artifacts must permit replay; blob/object storage locations are recorded alongside metadata.
- Secret management: Secrets/keys MUST NOT be committed.
  Store them in a gitignored `.env` file (or a secret manager) and access them via environment variables at runtime.
- Process identification: Every Python process MUST set a descriptive process title using `setproctitle` so hosts running multiple Python processes can distinguish them.

## Workflow & Quality Gates

- Use Spec-Driven Development and Test-Driven Development.
- Any change to data schemas, embedding parameters, or retrieval scoring requires a migration/test plan and version bump of the affected artifact.
- Code review checks for reproducibility (pinned deps, seeded operations), privacy adherence, and observability hooks (structured logs + metrics).
- Techstack/tooling choices for external services or internal frameworks MUST reference an ADR in `docs/decision-record/` or be manually overridden with references to other documents.
- Significant architectural decisions MUST have an ADR.

## Governance Practices

- Semantic Versioning is REQUIRED (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
- Conventional Commits are REQUIRED for commit messages and/or PR titles.
- Keep a Changelog is REQUIRED; maintain `CHANGELOG.md` following <https://keepachangelog.com>.
- After the first MINOR release, all changes affecting data/schema/contracts MUST include a migration plan and a deprecation schedule.

## Testing

- Run tests via `uv run pytest tests/`.
- For parallel execution, use `pytest-xdist`: `uv run pytest -n auto -m "not integration_lifecycle" tests/`.
- Tests marked `integration_lifecycle` (subprocess lifecycle with `pytest-isolate`) are incompatible with xdist; run them separately: `uv run pytest -m integration_lifecycle tests/`.
- Do not use `pytest-run-parallel` — it is a thread-safety stress tester (runs the same test N times in N threads), not a test suite parallelizer.

### Resource leak detection with pyleak

Use [pyleak](https://github.com/deepankarm/pyleak) to guard against leaked asyncio tasks and threads.
When writing tests for code that spawns concurrent work, wrap the act phase with the appropriate pyleak context manager:

- `no_task_leaks(action="raise")` — for code using `asyncio.create_task`, `asyncio.gather`, `asyncio.to_thread`, or `TaskGroup`.
- `no_thread_leaks(action="raise")` — for code using `ThreadPoolExecutor`, `threading.Thread`, or `subprocess.Popen` lifecycle management.

Existing examples: `test_fetcher.py`, `test_async_utils.py`, `test_limiters.py`, `test_health_checks.py`, `test_worker_shutdown.py`.

## Sandbox Limitations

- The sandbox cannot run `uv sync` or read `.env` / `.env.example` (permission errors).
- `tests/conversion/conftest.py` imports `aizk.conversion.db` → `pydantic_settings`, which may fail with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pydantic_settings.sources.providers.secrets'` if sandbox permissions are too strict.
- **Delegate test runs to the user** when any of the above errors occur.
  Describe the exact command to run (e.g., `uv run pytest tests/...`).
